# Tesla Advert

## About
A sleek advert including an animation created using Blender by moving different parts of a 3D Tesla model (made by Davide Tirindelli).

## Purpose
This project was used to help me learn about creating and rendering animations using Blender then taking the video of that animation and putting it on a website. I learn about the different camera perpectives on Blender and how to add different key frames for an animation on Blender. I was also able to use GSAP which I had learnt how to use from previous projects to add some animation effects to the text.

## Challenges
I spent some time playing around with adding different key frames and camera perspectives to get different shots of the car model which was difficult at first but I am really happy with what I created.

## Next Steps
There are no future plans for this project but I do plan on creating a more complex model of my own from scratch on Blender. I want to build a model of a room. I have sketched it out on procreate so I want to make it on blender and create an animation that would be added to a website.
